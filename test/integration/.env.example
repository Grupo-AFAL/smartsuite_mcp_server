# SmartSuite TEST Credentials for Integration Tests
#
# ⚠️  IMPORTANT: Use TEST/DEVELOPMENT credentials only!
# ⚠️  NEVER use production credentials in this file!
#
# Setup:
#   1. Copy this file to .env:
#      cp test/integration/.env.example test/integration/.env
#
#   2. Fill in your TEST credentials (NOT production!)
#
#   3. Run integration tests:
#      ruby test/integration/test_integration.rb
#
# Note: Integration tests load credentials ONLY from this .env file.
#       They will never use ENV variables from your shell, preventing
#       accidental use of production credentials.
