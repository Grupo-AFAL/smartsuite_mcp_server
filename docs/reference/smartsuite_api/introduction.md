# Introduction

This is the reference for the SmartSuite API. Use the sidebar to explore the API and learn more about important concepts.

The SmartSuite API can be used to integrate your data in SmartSuite with external systems. The API closely follows REST semantics, uses JSON to encode objects, and relies on standard HTTP codes to signal operation outcomes.

> **Note:** We have recently re-named Apps to "Tables" and this documentation site has been updated to reflect that change. Note that many API endpoints still refer to "Applications" or "Apps" - you should know that these refer to the objects now known as Tables.
